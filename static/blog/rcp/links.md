The Swiss laws define two constructs to promote the self-consumption of locally generated renewable electricity: the grouping for self consumption and the  local energy community. These constructs differ for extension and type of connection to the power grid.


## Grouping for self-consumption
This construct applies to a building connecting multiple consumers and renewable generation sources, each with a separate billing contract with the utility. It allows consumers to access local renewable generation at a more convenient price than importing that same electricity through its utility power meter. This construct applies to any renewable generation source provided that the production capacity is at least 10% of the nodal power and with at least 500 hours of working time per year. 

Starting from January 1 2025, the grouping for self-consuption extends to resources connected at different points of the grid as far as these are below 1 kV.

## Local energy communities
Similarly to the grouping for self-consumption, local energy communities allow consumers to access cheaper local electricity by avoiding direct billing through individual utility power meters. However, while grouping for self-consumption applies to consumers behind a single grid connection point (such as a building), local energy communities extend to multiple connection points, envisaging the use of the local distribution grid infrastructure to enable the transfer of power. Local energy communities cannot extend to areas larger than a municipality, and all connected consumers and producers should be on the same grid level and reasonably close to each other. The installed generation capacity should amount to at least 20% of the total demand.

Within the local energy community, electricity is traded according to rules and tariffs that are established locally. To account for the utilization of the grid infrastructure, grid tariffs (with a cost reduction of up to 60% compared to the conventional one) are applied.

## Final remarks
These two constructs favor electricity consumers by allowing them to access cheaper renewable generation, avoiding being billed for the full electricity retail price even if the electricity were to come from a nearby PV installation.

These constructs are a re-arrangement of the power meter measurements for billing purpose; they won't alter physical power flows or require the installation of separate electrical connections. Thanks to enabling the access to more convenient local electrical generation, consumers will certainly benefit to shift electricity consumption to times when (cheap) local renewable generation is available. Shifting consumption

Economic operations 

These measures go in the direction of increasing self-consumption of locally generated electricity; from a system and grid perspective, this is advantegoues because it allows to reduce Joule losses in power cables and lines and possibly better utilizaiton of the power distribution grids, with less congestions and improved voltage levels.
